# C - More Functions, More Nested Loops

## Description
This project is part of the ALX SE Foundations curriculum and focuses on more functions and nested loops in the C programming language. The goal is to deepen the understanding of how to use functions, nested loops, and various related concepts in C.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following without the help of Google:
- What are nested loops and how to use them
- What is a function and how to use functions
- The difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
- What is a prototype
- The scope of variables
- What are the gcc flags `-Wall`, `-Werror`, `-pedantic`, `-Wextra`, and `-std=gnu89`
- What are header files and how to use them with `#include`

## Requirements
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc. is forbidden
- You are allowed to use
