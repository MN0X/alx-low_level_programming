# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops

This project contains tasks for learning about functions and nested loops in C.

## Tasks

0. **_putchar** - Write a program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line.
1. **I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game** - Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
2. **10 x alphabet** - Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
3. **islower** - Write a function that checks for lowercase character.
4. **isalpha** - Write a function that checks for alphabetic character.
5. **Sign** - Write a function that prints the sign of a number.
6. **There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you** - Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
7. **There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important** - Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.
8. **I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life** - Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
9. **Learn your times table** - Write a function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- No global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- No standard library functions allowed except `_putchar`
- You don’t have to push `_putchar.c`, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
- The prototypes of all functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in the header file called `main.h`
- Don’t forget to push your header file
